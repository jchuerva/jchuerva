## Manage multiple stashes

```
> git stash list
stash@{0}: WIP on master: 5002d47 our new homepage
stash@{1}: WIP on master: 5002d47 our new homepage
stash@{2}: WIP on master: 5002d47 our new homepage
```

It's good practice to add a description in your stashes:

```
git stash save "this is a comment on the stash"
```

## Pop stash

Popping your stash **removes** the changes from your stash and reapplies them to your working copy.

By default, `git stash pop` will re-apply the **most recently created stash**: `stash@{0}`

The simple thing is to list all stashes and then apply the one you need

```
> git stash list
stash@{0}: WIP on master: 5002d47 our new homepage
stash@{1}: WIP on master: 5002d47 our new homepage
stash@{2}: WIP on master: 5002d47 our new homepage

> git stash pop stash@{2}
```

## Apply stash

Apply the changes to your working copy and **keep them** in your stash

```
git stash apply
```

If you want to select an specific stash:

```
git stash apply stash@{2}
```

## Delete a stash

You can delete an specific stash:
```
git stash drop stash@{1}
```

or delete all your stashes:
```
git stash clear
```

## Create a branch from your stash

```
git stash branch add-stylesheet stash@{1}
```

This checks out a new branch based on the commit that you created your stash from, and then **pops your stashed changes** onto it.
