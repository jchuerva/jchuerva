What a year. Besides the global pandemic, I’ve learned quite a lot this year:

- Improve my Rails confident. I love ruby syntax for clarity, but this year I’ve learn so many rails magic: scopes, migrations, better performance sql injections, activerecord relationships, mocha, etc...I should give a try to python/django but as much I feel more confident with Rails, it’s harder give it a try. 
- Some JavaScript syntax. I’ve done few courses but the one I recommend is [ES6 for everyone](https://es6.io)
- Some knowledge of Reactjs and Hooks. I like it, but I need to find some side project to play with, but first I need to finish [Epic react course](https://epicreact.dev). By far, it’s the most interactive and extended course I’ve done this year.
- Lose the fear of mixing programming languages in the same project, and learn each one has its scope. Mixing Rails with Reactjs is the perfect example of it. 
- React Native is fun!! I’ve been playing with it and create a small game using [Expo](https://expo.io)
- Take notes is hard but key for learning well. I’m using the [Zettelkasten](https://takesmartnotes.com) method for it to create connected notes. It would help me develop new ideas and write better blog entries 😏
- Soft skills are as important as programming skills. *Treat yours teammates as you want to be treated*, that’s a good logic.
