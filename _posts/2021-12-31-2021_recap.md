2021 has been a weird year with a lot of learning. I’ve learned a lot of new things, but I’ve also learned a lot of things I’ve already known.

- Rails is still the best framework for me or at least the one I feel more confident with.
- Change team is hard and being productive in it takes time, but I think I've contributed on my new team.
- ReactJS... I haven't done too much this year... or at least not as much as last year. I like it, but I need to find some side project to play with, but first I need to finish [Epic react course](https://epicreact.dev).
- Golang. I've started learning it but I haven't done it too consistency. I need to keep learning it and do more [exercism](https://exercism.org) exercises.



Here are some goals for 2022:
- 🏃 Build a running habit and lose weight
- 🚀 Promoting to senior developer
- 🇫🇷 French lessons
- 👨‍💻 Become fluent writing Golang and use it to replace Ruby
