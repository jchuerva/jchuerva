I've discovered the [direnv](https://direnv.net/) tool. It allows load and unload environment variables depending on the directory.

[GitHub repo](https://github.com/direnv/direnv)

#### Installation

As few other tools, the easiest way is using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```
brew install direnv
```

#### Configuration

Once it's installed, we need to add the following into ourt `~/.zshrc` file:
```bash
# load direnv
eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"
```

In the directory, we have to create the `.envrc` file, where we will store all the env variables.

eg `.envrc`:
```bash
 export kittens="awesome"
 export BASE_API_URL="https://xxxx.xxx"
```

Note: Remember include the `.envrc` in the `.gitignore`

#### Commands

- To allow (load) the new env variables:

```bash
direnv allow
```

- In case you want to unload/deny these env variables:

```bash
direnv deny
```
